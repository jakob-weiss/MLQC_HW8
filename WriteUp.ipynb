    "1. One hot encoding of the atom type. The supported atom types include C, N, O, S, F, Si, P, Cl, Br, Mg, Na, Ca, Fe, As, Al, I, B, V, K, Tl, Yb, Sb, Sn, Ag, Pd, Co, Se, Ti, Zn, H, Li, Ge, Cu, Au, Ni, Cd, In, Mn, Zr, Cr, Pt, Hg, Pb.\n",
    "2. One hot encoding of the atom degree. The supported possibilities include 0 - 10.\n",
    "3. One hot encoding of the number of implicit Hs on the atom. The supported possibilities include 0 - 6.\n",
    "4. Formal charge of the atom.\n",
    "5. Number of radical electrons of the atom.\n",
